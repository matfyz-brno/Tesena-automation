## Tesena-automation

Automated end-to-end QA tests for a PrestaShop demo store using **Cypress.io**.

This repository contains a practical QA test suite written in JavaScript with Cypress to validate core frontend customer flows of a PrestaShop e-commerce site.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements automated UI tests for the following scenarios:

1. **User Registration & Account Data Validation** – verify new user can register successfully.
2. **Smoke Check** – verifies that the homepage loads correctly and key UI elements are visible.
3. **Search Functionality** – validate that product search returns results.
4. **Cart Workflow** – add product to cart and verify it appears in cart.

These tests demonstrate real user flows and criteria commonly checked in QA automation tasks.
